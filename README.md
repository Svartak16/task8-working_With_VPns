# task8-working_With_VPns
VPN Report Summary This task explored using VPNs for privacy and security. I used ProtonVPN's free tier to test its effectiveness. After setting up the VPN, I verified the IP address change and confirmed traffic encryption. Browsing speed was slightly reduced, and server options were limited on the free tier. Despite these limitations, the VPN successfully masked my IP and encrypted traffic. Key benefits include enhanced privacy and security, while limitations include speed reduction and restricted server access. Overall, VPNs are valuable for protecting online data, but free tiers may have constraints. Paid plans offer more features and better performance.
